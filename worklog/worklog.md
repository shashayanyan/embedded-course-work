# Introduction

This is **your worklog** when discovering programming for embedded systems. 
It should contain what you will need to reopen this project in 6 months 
or a year and be able to understand and evolve it.

Also, as an Appendix, there should be the necessary details about what is
new to you, something like a cheat sheet in some sense. Something you can 
go back to when your memory will not server you well.

# First Sprint

- [Setup](./setup.md)
- [Understanding the build](./build.md)
- [Understanding the execution](./execution.md)
- [Advanced debugging](./debugging.md)
